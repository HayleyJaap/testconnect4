# README

I am aware that Ruby on Rails is decidedly overkill for something as simple as Connect4, but all of my limited web development experience is with RoR and I did not have time to learn another technology/framework

## How to access the website:
In order to access the site, your system must have a working Rails environment so follow the steps below
1. Follow this guide to install ruby and rails (ignore the other steps): https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10
   * Ensure that you install Ruby 3.2.2 and Rails 7.0.6 to avoid any potential version compatability issues.
   * Instead of installing postgres, install sqlite3. My website does not use a database but Rails may get upset if you don't set it up.

2. Clone the repo into your desired directory (and navigate to inside the connect4 project if necessary).
3. Run the command: $ rails server
   * If the above command does not work, try running the commands below, then attempt to restart the server:
     * $ bundle install
     * $ rake db:migrate
5. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your desired web browser

## Files to look at
Below is the comprehensive list of files (all in the app directory) that I edited for this website:
* The three files under app/views/connect4_game/
* Everything under app/assets/stylesheets/
* app/controllers/connect4_game_controller.rb
* app/models/checker.rb and app/models/gameboard.rb

Everything else is auto generated by Rails and untouched by me.
